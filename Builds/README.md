# RSA Encryption and Decryption on Raspberry Pi Builds
*These are the RSA Encryption and Decryption builds*

## Legend
### Builds
+ [Serial](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Builds/Serial "Serial build"):
This build is the RSA encryption and decryption implementation that is executed in a single processor on a single node
+ [OMP](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Builds/OMP "OMP build"):
This build is the RSA encryption and decryption implementation that is executed with multiple processor on a single node
+ [MPI](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Builds/MPI "MPI build"):
This build is the RSA encryption and decryption implementation that is executed with a single processor on each node in a parallel cluster (CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS)
+ [OMP_MPI](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Builds/OMP_MPI "OMP_MPI build"):
This build is the RSA encryption and decryption implementation that is executed with multiple processor on each node in a parallel cluster (CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS)

### Others
+ [~Inputs](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Builds/~Inputs "~Inputs"):
This is some of the sample inputs for testing in different sizes
+ [~Key](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Builds/~Key "~Key"):
This is keys that are used in the encryption and decryption process, as well as a key generator
