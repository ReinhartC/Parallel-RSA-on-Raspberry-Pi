# RSA Serial Build
*RSA Encryption and Decryption serial implementation*

## Description
This RSA Encryption and Decryption build is the basic of all the builds. Every process is done on serial and no parallel processing or multithreading.

#### The processes are:
1. Loading the keys from the key file (*Public key* on encryption and *Private key* on decryption)
2. Loading the input file that will be processed (*Plaintext* on encryption and *Ciphertext* on decryption)
3. Encrypt/Decrypt the given lines.
4. Print the result to an output file
