# Parallel RSA on Raspberry Pi
***Final Project assignment***

## Project Description
The main purpose of this project is to research the best method to decrease processing time of a process through parallel computing approach. The case study that is used in this project is the RSA Encryption and Decryption with Raspberry Pi Cluster as the device.

The implementation that is used in this project is using OpenMP for the multithreading and MPI for the parallelization of the processes with the goal of decreasing the processing time compared to the one without said implementation on the same device.

## Legend
+ [Builds](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Builds "Builds") are the implementations for the RSA Encryption and Decryption. The detail of the implementation for every build (Serial, Multithread, Parallel, or Both Parallel Multithread) could be seen there
+ [Configurations](https://github.com/ReinhartC/Parallel-RSA-on-Raspberry-Pi/tree/master/Configurations) are a detailed tutorial to configure Raspberry Pi(s) to create a Parallel Raspberry Pi Cluster with MPICH
